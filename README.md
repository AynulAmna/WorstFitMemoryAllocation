# Worst Fit Memory Allocation Simulation

## Overview
This project implements the **Worst Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It simulates how processes are allocated to memory blocks based on the Worst Fit strategy, where each process is assigned to the largest available memory block that can fit it.

## Features
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Users can enter memory block sizes and process sizes.
- **Memory Allocation Simulation:** The Worst Fit algorithm is applied based on user input.
- **Interactive Results Display:** Results are shown in a dynamic table with remaining memory details.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the web interface
- **CSS**: Styling and layout
- **JavaScript**: Algorithm implementation and UI interaction

## How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AynulAmna/WorstFitMemoryAllocation.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd worst-fit-memory-allocation
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
   - Alternatively, use **VS Code Live Server** for live testing.

## How to Use
1. Enter memory block sizes and process sizes in the input fields.
2. Click the **"Allocate Memory"** button.
3. View the allocation results displayed in a dynamic table.
4. Click **"Show Remaining Memory"** to see memory status after each process allocation.

## Testing
The project has been tested with various scenarios, including normal, edge, and extreme cases, ensuring accurate memory allocation.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for other memory allocation algorithms (First Fit, Best Fit, Next Fit).
- Visual memory representation using charts.
- Backend integration for saving and exporting results.
